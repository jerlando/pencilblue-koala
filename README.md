Installation
-----

The instructions below assume that Node.js and MongoDB are installed on your machine. If they are not then please visit http://nodejs.org and http://www.mongodb.org to install them.

##### PencilBlue Command-line interface
 1. Install the pencilblue-cli module: ```sudo npm install -g pencilblue-cli```
 2. Run ```pencilblue install [directory]``` where [directory] is the directory you want PencilBlue to be installed to.
 3. Follow the install instructions
 4. After the installation is done, ```cd``` into the folder where you installed PencilBlue
 5. Run ```pencilblue start```

##### Manual installation
 1. Clone the PencilBlue repository
 2. ```cd``` into the cloned repository's folder
 3. Run ```npm install``` to retrieve PencilBlue's dependencies. Depending on your system access privileges, you may have to run  ```sudo npm install```
 4. (Optional) Install [Redis](http://redis.io/) for caching
 5. (Optional) Create a custom configuration file using the provided ```sample.config.json```. The file can reside in two places: within the root folder of your installation as ```config.json``` or at ```/etc/pencilblue/config.json```. The installation root takes precedence. If running all services locally, no configuration file is needed, but a configuration file is necessary for overriding specific settings.
 6. Start PencilBlue. You can simply run ```node pencilblue```, but we recommend using [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.org/package/nodemon) for development and [forever](https://www.npmjs.org/package/forever) for production. Nodemon will restart PencilBlue on file changes and forever will ensure that PencilBlue is always running.
 ```
 # development
 nodemon pencilblue

 OR

 # production
 sudo forever start pencilblue.js
 ```
 7. Navigate to the site root you specified in a configuration file or http://localhost:8080 by default.
